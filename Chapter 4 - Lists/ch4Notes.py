#   1. Tuples are declared with ( )

#   2. Tuples are immutable

# value inside the parentheses indicates
# the only one value in the tuple
type(('hello',))
# %%
type(('hello'))
# Advantages of Tuples:
#   1. convey ordered sequence of values
#       that never change
#   2. b/c they are immutable and their
#       contents don't change, Python
#       can implement some optimizations

# %% list() and tuple() casting fn's

# %% References (integers are immutable)

# %% Lists are mutable

# append(), extend(), remove(), sort(), reverse()
#  and other list methods modify their lists in place
# Python's automatic garbage collector deletes and values

#  then use the copy.deepcopy() fn instead
# deepcopy() fn will copy inner lists as well
